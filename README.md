Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

This project is about my senior year passion: playing Overwatch, an online first-person shooter game produced by Blizzard Entertainment. I enjoy playing Overwatch not only because the game connects me with friends back home but also because I like to break gender stereotypes in gaming. 

This website is a short guide to the types of characters in Overwatch. It has a homepage detailed in index.html that uses a bootstrap navbar, an image, a three-column card component from bootstrap, and a footer. The navbar redirects users to one of three subpages: tank heroes, damage heroes, and support heroes built in tank.html, damage.html, and support.html respectively. 

tank.html features a navbar, an image, caption, a bootstrap table, and a basic footer. 

damage.html features a navbar, an image, caption, a bootstrap media unordered list component, and a basic footer.

support.html features a two-column grid, an embedded YouTube video, a bootstrap table, and a basic footer.
